My name is Changwook Doh. Felt difficult to pronounce my name? Just call me "Chang". :)

I love deep-diving into communities, making relationships and contributing to them. I dedicated in many different mobile fields such as embedded, 2D/3D game, virtual machine, middleware platforms and tools. Recently I had worked as an evangelist in HTML5 Tool company. If you want to know about me in detail, here's &nbsp;<a href="{{ site.linkedin }}"><span class="icon-16 linkedin"></span> my resume</a>.

Recently I enjoy contributing to opensources, communities and events.

> Oh, I have been doing translations of [HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/ko/) into Korean and maintaining <a href="http://{{ site.blogger }}.blogspot.kr/"><span class="icon-16 blogger"></span> HTML5Rocks/KO</a> which is a summary of all that translations. If you were interested in translating, I'd liked to encourage reading this [simple guide](http://goo.gl/67ZCuU) and visiting [Trello board](http://goo.gl/RvPYqK).
